| Field | Service | Table | Type | Detailed description | Possible values |
|-------|---------|-------|------|----------------------|------------------|
| role | auth | system_user | text + `CHECK` | The single role a system user has. Drives every route guard and permission check (`security-policy.md`). A user has exactly one role, never more than one. `SERVICE` exists only inside service tokens and is never stored here (ADR-006). | `ADMIN`, `SALESPERSON`, `INVENTORY` |
| active | every domain | every table with a lifecycle | boolean | Soft-delete flag, per ADR-001 §7. The service's database role has no `DELETE` permission, so the database itself enforces it. `false` means the row is logically deleted — it must be excluded from normal reads but never physically removed, to preserve traceability (NFR-009). Meaning shifts slightly per entity: for `system_user`, `false` blocks login; for `customer`, `false` blocks new sales (see `sales.customer_id`); for `products`, `false` blocks new sale lines. | `true`, `false` |
| token | auth | refresh_token | text | **A hash** of the refresh token issued to a client session, never the token itself. One-time use — rotated on every refresh per `security-policy.md`. | Hash string, unique |
| identity_document | customers | customer | text, 1–30 characters | Cédula or NIT. The real-world lookup key sales staff use at the point of sale — not the internal `customer_id`. Unique across all customers, active or not. | Any valid Colombian ID/NIT format |
| key | auth, customers (and every domain that creates over HTTP) | idempotency_key | text, 8–128 characters | The `Idempotency-Key` a client sent when creating a resource. Written in the same transaction as the resource; a retry with the same key returns the original resource instead of creating a second one (ADR-005). | Client-generated value, unique per table |
| price | products | products | NUMERIC(12,2) | Current unit price. Not historical — see `sale_details.unit_price` for the frozen price at the moment of a specific sale. | `> 0` |
| stock | products | products | INTEGER | Units currently available. Decremented automatically when a sale is confirmed (FR-007); never allowed to go negative. | `>= 0` |
| customer_id | sales | sales | UUID | **Looks like a foreign key but is not one.** Points to `customers.customer_id` in a different schema/service. Validated via a synchronous HTTP call to `customers-service` at sale creation — the database itself does not enforce this relationship. | Must be an existing, `active = true` customer |
| created_by | sales | sales | UUID | **System user who registered the sale.** External reference to `auth.users.user_id`, same pattern as `customer_id`: validated at runtime via the JWT `sub` claim, not a DB foreign key. Added by ADR-002 to enable the SALESPERSON "own sales" permission and to resolve STRIDE threats R-3 (repudiation) and I-4 (information disclosure). | Must be a valid `user_id` from a verified JWT |
| product_id | sales | sale_details | UUID | Same pattern as `sales.customer_id`: an external reference to `products.product_id`, validated over HTTP, not a DB-level FK. | Must be an existing, `active = true` product |
| unit_price | sales | sale_details | NUMERIC(12,2) | **Frozen at the moment of sale.** Copied from the product's `price` when the line is created and never updated again — even if the product's price changes afterward. This is the field most likely to be misread as "the product's current price"; it is not. | `> 0` |
| subtotal | sales | sale_details | NUMERIC(14,2) | Always equal to `quantity * unit_price`, enforced by a DB `CHECK` constraint — never computed or overridden by application code independently of that formula. | `= quantity * unit_price` |
| total | sales | sales | NUMERIC(14,2) | Sum of all `sale_details.subtotal` rows for that sale. | `>= 0` |
| date | sales | sales | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the sale was created. Named `date`, not `created_at`, per ADR-001's own field naming. | Any valid timestamp |
| daily_sales_total, monthly_sales_total, quantity_sold, product_id | sales | sales_summary | NUMERIC / INTEGER / UUID | **Not populated by any process in the MVP.** These columns exist because ADR-001 names them, but no job or trigger currently writes to this table. Per ADR-002, reports are served via aggregation queries over `sales` and `sale_details` instead. Do not assume this table has data. | — |
