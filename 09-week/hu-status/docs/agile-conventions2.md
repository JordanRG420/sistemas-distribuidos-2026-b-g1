# Agile Team Conventions

> Defines how the team works through its development cycles. Agreed on with the
> entire team. Update when the team decides to change something.

## Sprint structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Duration | 1 week |
| Sprint start | Monday |
| Sprint end | Sunday |
| Current sprint | Sprint 9 — Week 9 of the project (16 weeks total) |
| Estimated capacity | No point estimation yet (see note below) |

> **Note:** The team uses **HU (User Story) as the only work item type**, without distinguishing Task/Spike/HU — this includes both product features and documentation/research tasks (PDR, ADR, context map, governance, etc.). Point estimation (see scale below) starts once real product feature HUs (code) exist; it does not apply to documentation HUs.

## Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning
- **When:** first day of the sprint (Monday)
- **Duration:** maximum 1 hour
- **Who:** entire team
- **Goal:** select and commit to the sprint's tasks/HUs, break them down into technical tasks
- **Output artifact:** GitHub Project updated with the sprint's items

### Daily Stand-up
- **When:** asynchronous, via each member's weekly README (`NN-week/hu-status/README.md`)
- **Format:**
  1. What did I do?
  2. What will I do?
  3. Is anything blocking me?
- **Rule:** technical discussions are resolved outside this report, not inside it

### Sprint Review
- **When:** last day of the sprint (Sunday)
- **Duration:** maximum 30 minutes
- **Who:** team only (no Product Owner)
- **Goal:** internally show what was built/documented that week before presenting it to the Product Owner

### Weekly (with Product Owner)
- **When:** Wednesday of each week, reviewing the previous week's work (e.g. Wednesday of week 4 reviews what was done in week 3)
- **Duration:** maximum 1 hour
- **Who:** team + Product Owner (the course instructor)
- **Goal:** present what was built/documented the previous week, collect feedback from the Product Owner, and use the same session to refine and detail the following week's tasks/HUs (merges the function of a PO-facing Sprint Review and Backlog Refinement into a single ceremony, since both depend on the instructor's weekly availability)
- **Exit criterion:** the following week's task/HU meets the Definition of Ready (DoR)

### Sprint Retrospective
- **When:** last day of the sprint (Sunday), after the internal Sprint Review
- **Duration:** maximum 30 minutes
- **Who:** team only (no Product Owner)
- **Format:** What went well / What to improve / Action commitments
- **Rule:** each retro produces at least 1 improvement action with an owner

## Estimation

### Scale
| Points | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | Trivial — done in hours |
| 2 | Small — done in one day |
| 3 | Medium — takes 2–3 days |
| 5 | Large — takes almost a full sprint |
| 8 | Very large — should be split |
| 13 | Epic — MUST be split before the sprint |

**Technique:** Informal Planning Poker (team discussion, no dedicated tool)
**Applies from:** the first real product HUs (implementation Sprint 1)

### Estimation rule
- If there is disagreement of 2+ levels, discuss before voting again.
- If a story is estimated at 8 or 13, it must be split into smaller sub-tasks.

## Backlog tool

**Tool:** GitHub Projects
**Board URL:** [Synkro Tech — Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/code-corhuila/projects/24)

### Board columns
| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| What did I do? | Record of what was completed in the period |
| Up Next | Next planned tasks |
| Blockers | Impediments or dependencies |
| In Review | Under review by another team member |
| Done | Meets the Definition of Done (DoD) and is closed |

## Team velocity

| Sprint | Items completed | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Sprint 0 (weeks 1-2) | 8 HU | Discovery documentation (PDR, ADR-001) |
| Sprint 3 (week 3) | 22 HU | PDR/ADR correction + context map + populating `00-governance`, `01-context`, and `02-domain` |
| Sprint 4 (week 4) | 5 HU | Service catalog, user-stories.md/NFRs formalization, panoramic MVP (Cut 2) |
| Sprint 5-6 (weeks 5-6) | 3 HU | ADR-001 publication, deployment + threat model, ADR-002 sale authorship (HU-04) |
| Sprint 7 (week 7) | 10 HU | FR/NFR unification and traceability matrix (HU-DOCS-25, 26, 27), git-conventions alignment (HU-DOCS-28), ADR-003 + downstream and hexagonal architecture guide (HU-ARQ-14, 15), domain events and UML diagrams (HU-DOCS-29, 30), and the first two review corrections — PR #17 citation and C4 sync note (HU-DOCS-31, 33) |
| Sprint 8 (week 8) | 26 HU | HU-08 remaining corrections (HU-DOCS-32, 34, 41 and HU-ARQ-16); HU-09 first-pass contracts (7 HU); HU-10 architecture decisions — ADR-005 to ADR-008 and downstream documents (15 HU) |
| Sprint 9 (week 9) | 19 HU | HU-11 DB topology correction (ADR-009) and contract rewrites (9 HU); HU-12 governance, context, requirements and architecture alignment (10 HU). HU-13 (9 HU: Auth and Customers contracts, DDL prefixes, domain map, context sweep, backlog closure, stack guides, ⭐ documents, developer documents) is in progress and is added to this row when the sprint closes |
| Average | — | Will be calculated once implementation starts (story points) |

> **Note:** sprint labels/week mapping above follow the pattern already
> established by the Sprint 0/Sprint 3 rows (1 sprint ≈ 1 week, with
> occasional 2-week or split sprints). Confirm these labels match the
> team's actual sprint calendar before merging — this file infers them
> from work already delivered, not from an authoritative sprint log.
