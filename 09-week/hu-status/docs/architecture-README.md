# ADRs — Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records one architectural decision: the problem, the options the team really considered, what tipped the decision, what it costs and what it changes. Each ADR is one file in `records/`.

## How to create an ADR

1. Copy `_template-adr.md` to `records/ADR-NNN-short-title.md`, using the next sequential number.
2. Fill in every section. An ADR needs at least two real options, a dominant criterion and an accepted cost; without the last two it is a statement, not a decision.
3. Open a `docs/` branch and a PR that contains the ADR and its row in the register below. The whole team reviews it.
4. While its status is `Proposed`, the ADR can still be edited.
5. Once `Accepted`, the ADR is never edited. A change is a new ADR that names the sections it replaces in its **Modifies** field, and the register records the link in both directions.

## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Proposed` | Under discussion; it can still be edited |
| `Accepted` | Approved by the team; immutable from this point on |
| `Rejected` | Evaluated and discarded; the ADR keeps the reason |
| `Superseded by ADR-NNN` | Every decision in it has been replaced by a newer ADR |

When a newer ADR replaces only some sections of an older one, the older ADR stays `Accepted`, and the register lists the replaced sections in the **Modified or superseded by** column.

Every new ADR adds its own row in the same PR, and updates the **Modified or superseded by** cell of each ADR it modifies.
